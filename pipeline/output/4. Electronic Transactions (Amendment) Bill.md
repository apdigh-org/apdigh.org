## Application

2. This Act applies to electronic transactions and electronic records of every type.

## Scope of Act

3. (1) This Act shall not be interpreted so as to exclude statutory law or the principles of the common law being applied to, recognising or accommodating electronic transactions, electronic records or any other matter provided for in this Act.

(2) Unless otherwise provided, this Act shall not be construed as

- (a) requiring a person to generate, communicate, produce,  process, send, receive, record, retain, store or display information, document or signature by or in electronic form; or
- (b) prohibiting a person from establishing requirements in respect of the manner in which that person will accept electronic records.

(3) This  Act  does  not  limit  the  operation  of  law  that  expressly authorises, prohibits or regulates the use of electronic records and any legal  requirement  law  for  information  to  be  posted,  displayed  or transmitted in a specified manner.

## Electronic transactions

## Recognition of electronic message

4. Except as provided in this Act, where a law provides that information or any  other  matter  shall  be  in  writing,  typewritten  or  in  printed  form,  the requirement shall be deemed to have been satisfied if the information or matter is

- (a) rendered or made available in an electronic form,
- (b) accessible, and
- (c) capable of being retained for a subsequent reference despite the contrary intention in the law.

## Original writing

5. (1) Where a law requires information to be presented or retained in its original  form, the requirement shall  be deemed to have been satisfied by an electronic record if

- (a) there is reliable assurance of the integrity of the electronic record, and

- (b) the electronic record is capable of being displayed to the person to whom it is to be presented.

(2) The criteria to assess integrity shall be whether the information has remained complete and unaltered and the information shall be assessed taking into consideration the relevant circumstances for which the information was generated to determine the standard of reliability.

## Admissibility and evidential weight of electronic records

6. (1)  The  admissibility  of  an  electronic  record  shall  not  be  denied  as evidence in legal proceedings except as provided in this Act.

(2) In assessing the evidential weight of an electronic record the Court shall have regard to

- (a) the reliability of the manner in which the electronic record was generated, displayed, stored or communicated,
- (b) the  reliability  of  the  manner  in  which  the    integrity  of  the information was maintained,
- (c) the manner in which its originator was identified, and
- (d) any other facts that the Court may consider relevant.

## Retention of electronic records

7. (1) Where a law requires that a document, record or information shall be retained, that requirement is deemed to have been met if the document, record or information is held in electronic form and

- (a) is accessible,
- (b) is capable of retention for subsequent reference,
- (c) is  retained  in  the  format  in  which  it  was  generated,  sent  or received, or in a format which can be demonstrated to represent accurately the information generated, sent or received, and
- (d) is retained to enable the identification of the origin  and destination of the electronic record and the date and time when it was sent or received.

(2) The document, record or information shall be kept in electronic form for at least six years.

(3) An obligation to retain a document, record or information does not extend to information which is only to enable the message to be sent or received.

## Secure electronic record

8. (1) Where a security procedure has been applied to an electronic record at a specific point in time, the record is deemed to be a secure electronic record during the period when the security procedure was applied.

(2) An unauthorised alteration of the security procedure renders the record invalid.

(3) An alteration is unauthorised if it is done by a person without the  lawful  authority  of  the  person  who  originally  applied  the  security procedure.

## Digital and electronic signatures

9. (1) Where a law requires the signature of a person, that requirement is deemed to be satisfied in relation to an electronic record if a digital or electronic signature is used.

- (2) A digital or electronic signature is deemed to be authentic if
2. (a) the means of creating the digital or electronic signature is, within the context in which it is used, linked to the signatory and not to another person,
3. (b) the means of creating the digital or electronic signature was, at the time of signing, under the control of the signatory and not another person without duress or undue influence,
4. (c) an alteration to the digital or electronic signature, made after the time of signing, is detectable
- (3) Subsection (2) does not limit the right of a person
6. (a) to prove the authenticity of a digital or electronic signature in any other way,  or
7. (b) to adduce evidence in respect of the non-authenticity of a digital or electronic signature.
- (4) Digital and electronic signature certificates shall be issued only upon the conduct of rigorous identity verification, including but not limited to biometric authentication and validation against a national identification  database,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the National Identification Authority Act, 2006 (Act 707), any Regulations made thereunder, or any other applicable enactments for the time being in force.

## Equal treatment of digital and electronic signatures

10. Except as provided in this Act, the provisions of this Act do not exclude, restrict,  or  deprive  of  legal  effect,  any  method  of  creating  a  digital  or electronic signature which

- (a) satisfies the requirements of this Act,
- (b) meets the requirements of other statutory provision, or
- (c) is provided for under a contract.

## Signing of an electronic record

(1)  Where  a  law  requires  a  signature,  statement  or  document  to  be notarised,  acknowledged,  verified  or  made  under  oath,  that  requirement  is deemed  to  be  satisfied  if  the  electronic  or  digital  signature  of  the  person authorised to perform those acts is affixed to an electronic record.

(2) Where a law requires or permits a person to provide a certified copy of a document and the document exists in paper or in another physical form,

that requirement is deemed to be satisfied if an electronic copy of the document is certified to be a true copy by using the electronic or digital signature of the certifying person.

## Other requirements

15 . (1)  A  requirement  in  law  for  multiple  copies  of  a  document  to  be submitted to a single addressee at the same time, is satisfied by the submission of  a  single  electronic  record  that  is  capable  of  being  reproduced  by  the addressee.

(2) Where a corporate seal is required to be affixed to a document, that requirement is deemed to be satisfied if the electronic or digital signature of the corporate  body  is  affixed  to  the  electronic  record  in  accordance  with  the provisions relating to the use of the corporate seal.

(3)An automated transaction is valid even if an electronic agent is involved at any stage of its formation.

(4) A party interacting with an electronic agent to make an agreement is not bound by the terms of the agreement unless the terms were capable at  first  of  being  accessed  by  the  party  prior  to  the  formation  of  the contract.

(5) An electronic contract is not valid where an individual interacts directly  with  the  electronic  agent  and  has  made  a  material  error during the creation of an electronic record and
