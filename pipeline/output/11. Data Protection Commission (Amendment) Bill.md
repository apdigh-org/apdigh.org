- (b) in a lawful and reasonable manner;
- (c) for a specified purpose compatible with further processing;
- (d) in a manner that adheres with standards of quality of information and openness;

(4) For the avoidance of doubt, ownership of computer equipment, databases, or software systems used to store or process personal data shall not confer ownership of the personal data contained therein.

## Data Protection Impact Assessment

47. (1) Where a data processing activity is likely to pose real risk to the rights and freedoms of a data subject, the data controller or data processor shall conduct a data protection impact assessment prior to processing the personal data.

(2)    In  consideration  of  the  rights  and  legitimate  interests  of  data subjects, the data protection  impact  assessment  must  encompass  the following elements:

- (a) details  of  the  intended  processing  activities,  the  purposes  of  the intended processing activities, and any legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or data processor.
- (b) an  evaluation  of  the  legal  basis,  and  appropriateness  of  the processing activities with respect to their intended purposes.
- (c) an appraisal of the potential risks posed to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

(3)    Should  a  data  protection  impact  assessment  conducted  under  this section reveal that the processing of data would likely result in a real high risk to the rights and freedoms of a data subject, the data controller or data processor is  obligated to submit a report to the Authority for review and approval before proceeding with the processing.

(4) The Authority shall provide comprehensive guidelines for the execution of  impact  assessments  as  outlined  in  this  section,  ensuring  clarity  and consistency in their implementation.

- (c) an assessment of whether the legitimate interest outweighs the rights and freedoms of the data subject.

(3) The data controller shall document the Legitimate Interest Assessment and maintain records demonstrating compliance with this section.

(4) Where the data subject objects to processing on grounds relating to their rights and freedoms, the data controller shall reassess the Legitimate Interest Assessment and  cease  processing  where  the  interests  of  the  data  subject override the legitimate interest.

(5) The Authority may  request access to the Legitimate Interest Assessment documentation to verify compliance with this section.

## Data protection by design and by default

49. (1) A data controller or data processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures which are designed-

(a) to implement the data protection principles in an effective manner; and

(b) to integrate necessary safeguards for that purpose into the processing.

(2)    The  duty  under  subsection  (1)  applies  both  at  the  time  of  the determination  of  the  means  of  processing  the  data  and  at  the  time  of  the processing.

(8) Where the Authority has grounds to believe that publicity would protect  a  data  subject  who  is  affected  by  the  unauthorised  access  or acquisition of data, the Authority may direct the data controller to publicise in  the  specified  manner,  the  fact  of  the  compromise  to  the  integrity  or confidentiality of the personal data. (9) A  data  controller  who  fails  to  notify  the  Authority  within  the stipulated 72 hours timeframe shall be subject to an administrative penalty of not  less  than  two  thousand  penalty  units  and  not  more  than  hundred thousand penalty units.

(3) Where the data controller and the data subject are unable to reach an agreement and if the data subject makes a request, the data controller shall attach to the record an indication that a request for the data has been made but has not been complied with.

(4) Where  the  data  controller  complies  with  the  request,  the  data controller  shall  inform  each  person  to  whom  the  personal  data  has  been disclosed of the correction made. The data controller shall notify the data subject of the action taken

(5) as a result of the request.

(6) The  data  subject  shall  bear  the  consequences  of  deletion  or destruction  of  personal  data  that  is  essential  for  a  service,  purpose,  or objective, or if it results in a breach of law, breach of legal obligations between parties, invalidation of service or application, eligibility of service, denial of service, unreliability of record, incorrect and incomplete outcomes.
